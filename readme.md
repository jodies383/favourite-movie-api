## In the movie api you can
- create a new account
- login
- add movies to a favourites playlist
- remove movies from a favourites playlist
- search for a movie
- view trending movies
- (user session expires after 4 hours)

## What I haven't added
- Many playlists for one user

## Issues
- There are some issues with logging in, however there are no errors so I'm not sure if it's a network problem
